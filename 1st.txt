1. Explain what javaScript is and the role of it in web development.

Ans: JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarilly used for web development. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the interativity and functionality of websites.
    
                                                  Key Role in Web Development:

1. Enhancing User Experience: 
 JavaScript allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It can be used to build features like sliders, form validation, pop-up dialogs, and other user interface elements that respond to user actions without the need for full page reloads.

2. Fetching Data:
 JavaScript can make asynchronous requests to servers (AJAX) to retrieve data in the background, making web applications more responsive and efficient.

3. Interactivity: 
 It enables event handling, enabling developers to define how a web page should respond to various user interactions such as clicks, keystrokes, and mouse movements.

4. Validation: 
 JavaScript can be used for client-side form validation, ensuring that user input is correct before being submitted to the server.

5. Animations and Effects:
 JavaScript is often used to create animations, transitions, and other visual effects that improve the user experience.

6. Third-Party Libraries and Frameworks:
 Developers often use JavaScript libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue.js to streamline development and build complex web applications.
