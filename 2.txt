2. Explain the key difference between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where you would use each.

 ANS:

    The key difference between JavaScript and HTML are as follows:

    (i) HTML is a markup language used to structure the content and layout of the web pages. It defines the elements and their arrangement on a web page.
        whereas,
        JavaScript is a programming language used to add Interactivity, manipulate the Document Object Model(DOM), and create dynamic behavior in the web pages.

   (ii) HTML provides the static and conntent of a web page. It describes how the content should be displayed, but it does not interativity or dynamic behavior.
        whereas,
        JavaScript allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive web content. It can respond to user actions, modify page elements fetch data from servers and more.

  (iii) Examples of HTML Use:
        Defining Content: HTML is used to create the basic structure of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and other content elements.
        Page Layout: It specifies the layout and structure of the page, including the use of headings, sections, headers, footers, and sidebars.
        Forms: HTML is used to create input forms for user data collection, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.

        whereas,

        Examples of JavaScript Use:
        Event Handling: JavaScript can respond to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input. For example, you can use JavaScript to create a button that displays an alert when clicked.
        DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can modify the content and structure of a web page in real-time. For instance, you can use JavaScript to change the text of an HTML element.
        Data Validation: JavaScript can validate user input in web forms before submission, ensuring that the data entered is correct and matches specified criteria.
        Asynchronous Requests: JavaScript can make AJAX requests to servers to fetch and display data without requiring a full page reload. This is commonly used in features like search suggestions and real-time updates.
